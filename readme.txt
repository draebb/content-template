Requires at least: 3.3
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 0.1.2

Define templates for repeated contents.

== Description ==

Content Template lets you save post title, content, excerpt, categories and tags as templates. Only "Post" is supported.

This plugin is not fitting for a multi-author environment. There are no permission settings; anyone who can add posts can manage templates. And save templates at the same time (from multiple users) may cause some template data lose.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the archive and put the `content-template` folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the Add New Post page and fill the fields that Content Template supports, then in the Content Template metabox enter the template name and click the Add New Template button. This metabox is also where you insert templates from.

== Screenshots ==

1. Content Template metabox.
